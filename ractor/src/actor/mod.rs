//! This module contains the basic building blocks of an actor.
//!
//! They are:
//! [Actor]: The behavior definition for an actor's internal processing logic + state management
//! [ActorRuntime]: Management structure processing the message handler, signals, and supervision events in a loop
//!
//! ## Actor Supervision
//!
//! Supervision is a special notion of "ownership" over actors by a parent (supervisor).
//! Supervisors are responsible for the lifecycle of a child actor such that they get notified
//! when a child actor starts, stops, or panics (when possible). The supervisor can then decide
//! how to handle the event. Should it restart the actor, leave it dead, potentially die itself
//! notifying the supervisor's supervisor? That's up to the implementation of the [super::Actor]
//!
//! This is currently an initial implementation of [Erlang supervisors](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html)
//!
//! An example supervision tree may look like:
//!
//! ```text
//! Root/
//! ├─ Actor A/
//! │  ├─ Actor A_1/
//! │  ├─ Actor A_2/
//! ├─ Actor B/
//! ├─ Actor C/
//! │  ├─ Actor C_1/
//! │  │  ├─ Actor C_1_1/
//! │  │  │  ├─ Actor C_1_1_1/
//! ```
//!
//! To link actors together in the supervision tree, there are 2 choices.
//!
//! 1. [Actor::spawn_linked] which requires supplying the supervisor to the actor upon spawning a child.
//! This call will link the supervision tree as early as possible in the lifecycle of the actors,
//! such that a failure or panic in `post_start` will be captured and notify the supervisor
//! 2. `ActorCell::link` will link actors together after-the-fact, once already spawned. This is helpful
//! for actors which are originally created independently but have some latent relationship to each
//! other. However due to startup routines and asynchronous processing, it's unlikely that failures
//! in `post_start` and any other asynchronous handling will be captured in the supervision tree.
//!
//! ## Handling panics
//!
//! Another point to consider in actor frameworks are `panic!`s. The actor runtime captures and transforms
//! a panic in an actor into the string message equivalent upon exit. However the traditional panic will still
//! log to `stderr` for tracing. You can additionally setup a [panic hook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.set_hook.html)
//! to do things like capturing backtraces on the unwinding panic.
