//! Represents an actor registry.
//!
//! It allows unique naming of actors via `String`
//! so it works more or less like an Erlang `atom()`
//!
//! Actors are automatically registered into the global registry, if they
//! provide a name, upon construction.Actors are also
//! automatically unenrolled from the registry upon being dropped, therefore freeing
//! the name for subsequent registration.
//!
//! You can then retrieve actors by name with [where_is]. Note: this
//! function only returns the [ActorCell] reference to the actor, it
//! additionally requires knowledge of the [crate::Actor] in order
//! to send messages to it (since you need to know the message type)
//! or agents will runtime panic on message reception, and supervision
//! processes would need to restart the actors.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! async fn test() {
//!     let maybe_actor = ractor::registry::where_is("my_actor".to_string());
//!     if let Some(actor) = maybe_actor {
//!         // send a message, or interact with the actor
//!         // but you'll need to know the actor's strong type
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
