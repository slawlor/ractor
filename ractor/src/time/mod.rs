//! Timers for sending messages to actors periodically
//!
//! The methodology of timers in `ractor` are based on [Erlang's `timer` module](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/timer.html).
//! We aren't supporting all timer functions, as many of them don't make sense but we
//! support the relevant ones for `ractor`. In short
//!
//! 1. Send on a period
//! 2. Send after a delay
//! 3. Stop after a delay
//! 4. Kill after a delay
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ractor::concurrency::Duration;
//! use ractor::{Actor, ActorProcessingErr, ActorRef};
//!
//! struct ExampleActor;
//!
//! enum ExampleMessage {
//!     AfterDelay,
//!     OnPeriod,
//! }
//!
//! #[cfg(feature = "cluster")]
//! impl ractor::Message for ExampleMessage {}
//!
//! #[cfg_attr(feature = "async-trait", ractor::async_trait)]
//! impl Actor for ExampleActor {
//!     type Msg = ExampleMessage;
//!     type State = ();
//!     type Arguments = ();
//!
//!     async fn pre_start(
//!         &self,
//!         _myself: ActorRef<Self::Msg>,
//!         _args: Self::Arguments,
//!     ) -> Result<Self::State, ActorProcessingErr> {
//!         println!("Starting");
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     async fn handle(
//!         &self,
//!         _myself: ActorRef<Self::Msg>,
//!         message: Self::Msg,
//!         _state: &mut Self::State,
//!     ) -> Result<(), ActorProcessingErr> {
//!         match message {
//!             ExampleMessage::AfterDelay => println!("After delay"),
//!             ExampleMessage::OnPeriod => println!("On period"),
//!         }
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let (actor, handle) = Actor::spawn(None, ExampleActor, ())
//!         .await
//!         .expect("Failed to startup dummy actor");
//!
//!     // send the message after a 100ms delay
//!     actor.send_after(Duration::from_millis(100), || ExampleMessage::AfterDelay);
//!
//!     // send this message every 10ms
//!     actor.send_interval(Duration::from_millis(10), || ExampleMessage::OnPeriod);
//!
//!     // Exit the actor after 200ms (equivalent of calling `stop(maybe_reason)`)
//!     actor.exit_after(Duration::from_millis(200));
//!
//!     // Kill the actor after 300ms (won't execute since we did stop before, but here
//!     // as an example)
//!     actor.kill_after(Duration::from_millis(300));
//!
//!     // wait for actor exit
//!     handle.await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
