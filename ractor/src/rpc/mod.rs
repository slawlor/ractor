//! Remote procedure calls (RPC) are helpful communication primitives to communicate with actors
//!
//! There are generally 2 kinds of RPCs, cast and call, and their definition comes from the
//! standard [Erlang `gen_server`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html#cast-2).
//! The tl;dr is that `cast` is an send without waiting on a reply while `call` is expecting
//! a reply from the actor being communicated with.
